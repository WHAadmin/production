       2023 Dissertation Prize Winners
      </h2>
      <p>
       Congratulations to our 2023 Dissertation Prize winner
       <strong>
        Mejgan Massoumi
       </strong>
       <span style="font-weight:400">
        , Fellow & Lecturer at the Stanford Civic, Liberal, and Global Education Program for her dissertation entitled "The Sounds of Kabul: Radio and the Politics of Popular Culture in Modern Afghanistan, 1960-79."
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       As noted by the committee:
       <span style="font-weight:400">
        This dissertation explores the history of Afghanistan as a major producer of music across Islamic Eurasia and throughout its own global diaspora. A project about global networks, it is based on research in many archives, including in Kabul, many of which the author visited against serious odds.&nbsp; Massoumi explains that the radio was a global technology that revolutionized the relationship between everyday people (both men and women) and the world and that permitted Afghans to articulate their place in the world through global lenses like the cold war, decolonization, and student movements worldwide. Massomi makes multiple important contributions to research and analysis in world history, including the emerging field identified as the history of sound. This dissertation presents an important analysis of the relationships between multiple spatial scales in modern world history, showing how radio and sound history offer a way to understand a synthesis of global and local. Moreover, this dissertation makes an excellent case for the importance of popular culture in the shaping of global connections. Massoumi&rsquo;s analysis of the populism of the Afghan pop star Ahmad Zahir, for example, is a significant contribution to understanding the relationships between pop culture, global cosmopolitanism, and local tradition. It shows the diffusion of popular culture through the diffusion of technology, demonstrating the rise of a local and regional culture that first assimilated and then disseminated secular world popular culture among a Muslim population that world history surveys seldom acknowledge.

       <span style="font-weight:400">
        <strong>
         Hayley Genevieve Brazier
        </strong>
        for her dissertation entitled &ldquo;Seafloor Machina: Aging Technologies in the Depths of the Pacific Ocean.&rdquo; As noted by the committee:
       </span>
       <span style="font-weight:400">
        This dissertation, an innovative interdisciplinary project that combines research in history and marine science, is a unique and skillfully researched study of the history of the impacts of industrial technologies on the ocean seafloor from the 1890s onward, with a focus on oil and gas drilling, undersea telegraph cables, and cabled observatories. The work is an important contribution to the &ldquo;blue humanities&rdquo; and to science and technology studies as well as world history. Brazier makes an excellent case for how historical study can assist in elucidating the long-term environmental impacts of industrial technology by drawing attention to global environmental impacts of late-nineteenth and twentieth-century imperialism. Her work touches on animal studies, technology, and industrialization, revealing a dazzling range of undersea human activity. This methodologically capacious work includes oral interviews and scientific information as well as archival records, and it deftly links ocean and industrial history to twenty-first century global concerns.

        <strong>
         Rob Konkel
        </strong>
        for his dissertation entitled "Building Blocs: Raw Materials and the Global Economy in the Age of Disequilibrium.&rdquo; As noted by the committee: This lively and relevant dissertation is a globally resonant account of trade in tungsten and manganese, two strategic raw materials needed for steelmaking, which were concentrated in locations that were remote from sites of advanced steel production. Konkel focuses on the decades between the 1880s and the 1940s and on the economic warfare and actual warfare that top steel producers engaged in to obtain the materials in question.&nbsp; The dissertation is well written, and the proposition that &ldquo;raw materials are key drivers of global history&rdquo; is a terrific one for the field to take up. The study is spatially acute, organized around its central proposition that heavy industry was intractably global even as locations of resources and production were relatively fixed and distant from one another. Konkel argues that &ldquo;bloc thinking&rdquo; in international affairs was an effort to sequester natural resource supply chains into self-contained units, and he is also well attuned to the implications of his work for contemporary concerns like the race for rare earths today.
