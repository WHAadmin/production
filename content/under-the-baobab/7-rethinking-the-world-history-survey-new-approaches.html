    Join colleagues from a range of institutions (public, private,
          community college), as we think about how to renew and invigorate the
          World History survey to make it meaningful and relevant to today&rsquo;s
          students. The scholar-teachers on this roundtable discuss how to
          infuse perspectives from postcolonial history, urban history, Big
          History, local history and migration studies into world history survey
          classes, as well as how best to assess students in the survey. After
          the initial presentations, participants will be asked to share their
          own innovations and practices in reinvigorating the survey.
