    We&rsquo;ll open this session with an introductory talk on the session&rsquo;s
          topic from Dr. Michael G. Vann. Afterward, Dr. Pavin Chachavalpongpun
          will speak on the historically significant role the Thai monarchy has
          played in global affairs. From the 19th to 20th century, the Thai
          monarchy fully engaged in a conduct of diplomacy at the critical time
          when colonialism attacked Southeast Asia, and thus, caught in the
          middle of two powers: Britain and France, kings of Siam (former name
          of Thailand) &ldquo;bent with the prevailing wind&rdquo; to save the kingdom and
          his throne from external threats. In the later 20th century, political
          interests between the United States and the monarchy were forever
          intertwined. Thailand, as a result, implemented a pro-US,
          anti-communist, pro-monarchy and pro-military policy, a standpoint
          that placed Washington at the heart of Thai affairs. This session will
          conclude an informal Q&A session.
