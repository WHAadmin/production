    Under the Baobab will commence with its first session in 2023 with session XV, &ldquo;Teaching and Learning World
      History in a time of &lsquo;Divisive Concepts.&rsquo; &ldquo;Divisive Concepts&rdquo; bills, which purportedly take aim at the teaching of
      Critical Race Theory, have proliferated across the United States within the last two years, significantly
      impacting instruction in history and the social studies. These bills restrict academic freedom in the classroom
      and are generally associated with the teaching of American exceptionalism. But what impact are these measures
      having on the teaching and learning of world history? In this session K-16 educators from different states will
      discuss the impact of &lsquo;anti-CRT&rsquo; or &lsquo;divisive concepts&rsquo; legislation, standards, and instructional materials.
